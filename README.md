Example of Java code
------------

Directory `surprisingStrings` contains a prototype implementation (unpublished) of the following paper:

* D. Belazzougui, F. Cunial (2015). [Space-efficient detection of unusual words](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-23826-5_22). SPIRE 2015, LNCS, volume 9309, pp 222-233.

The program detects all substrings, of any length, that occur in a text more frequently or less frequently than expected, according to an IID or a Markov model. The program can use multiple threads, and it is space-efficient since it is based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform.

To read representative examples of my coding style, I suggest looking at the following files:
* [SubstringIterator.java](https://github.com/fcunial/portfolio/blob/master/surprisingStrings/SubstringIterator.java)
* [Suffixes.java](https://github.com/fcunial/portfolio/blob/master/surprisingStrings/Suffixes.java)
* [BorderSubstring.java](https://github.com/fcunial/portfolio/blob/master/surprisingStrings/BorderSubstring.java)


**Requirements**

* A 64-bit Java compiler. The code was tested on Oracle's `javac 9.0.1`.
* A 64-bit operating system. The code was tested on macOS 10.13.

**Compiling**

Assuming the current directory is `surprisingStrings`:

```
javac -classpath .:./commons-math3-3.5.jar *.java
```

**Running**

Since this code is still a prototype, I created a test program with hardwired input arguments, to make running it easier. The program uses file `NC_021658.fna` included in the repository. 

Example run using `nThreads` parallel threads (assuming the current directory is `surprisingStrings`):
```
java -classpath .:./commons-math3-3.5.jar TestDrive nThreads
```

This simple program builds the BWT of `NC_021658.fna` and prints to STDOUT all substrings whose exact frequency is at least 100 times greater than expected according to an IID model (the model can easily be made non-uniform, e.g. by making character probabilities match their frequencies in the input). Please interrupt the program with CTRL+C, because the list of surprising strings is very long.

**Example output**

In the output, each string is followed by its exact frequency (denoted by `f=`) and by the following, space-separated scores:
* frequency-expectation
* frequency/expectation
* (frequency-expectation)/expectation
* (frequency-expectation)/sqrt(expectation)
* abs(frequency-expectation)/sqrt(expectation)
* (frequency-expectation)*(frequency-expectation)/expectation;
* (frequency-expectation)/sqrt(expectation*(1-probability))
* expectation/sqrt(variance)
* (frequency-expectation)/sqrt(variance)
* abs((frequency-expectation)/sqrt(variance))

Example of C code
------------

Directory `bwtman` contains a prototype implementation (unpublished) of the following paper:

* D. Belazzougui, F. Cunial (2017). [A framework for space-efficient string kernels](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00453-017-0286-4). Algorithmica, volume 79, pages 857â€“883.

For now the program detects just all *minimal absent words* (MAWs) of a text, of any length, and scores them based on an IID or Markov model of the text. A minimal absent word is a string that never appears in the input, but such that every one of its substrings appears (exactly) in the input. The program is space-efficient, since it is based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform. We are currently working on making it use multiple threads, and on supporting more string analysis algorithms with the same algorithmic framework, but this is still work in progress.

To read representative examples of my coding style, I suggest looking at the following files:
* [indexed_DNA5_seq.c](https://github.com/fcunial/portfolio/blob/master/bwtman/iterator/indexed_DNA5_seq.c)
* [indexed_DNA5_seq.h](https://github.com/fcunial/portfolio/blob/master/bwtman/iterator/indexed_DNA5_seq.h)
* [SLT_single_string.c](https://github.com/fcunial/portfolio/blob/master/bwtman/iterator/SLT_single_string.c)
* [SLT_single_string.h](https://github.com/fcunial/portfolio/blob/master/bwtman/iterator/SLT_single_string.h)


**Requirements**

* A modern C compiler with support for OpenMP. The code was tested on GCC 9.2.0.
* A 64-bit operating system. The code was tested on macOS 10.13.

**Compiling**

First, let's compile `libdivsufsort`, an [external library](https://github.com/y-256/libdivsufsort) that we use for constructing the Burrows-Wheeler Transform of the input text (it is already included in this repository). Assuming the current directory is `bwtman`, let's do:

```
cd libdivsufsort
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Release" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="." ..
make
```

Then, let's edit the first line of file `Makefile` in directory `bwtman` (the main directory of the project): on the first line, let's specify in variable `CC` the path of a C compiler that supports OpenMP (in some systems, e.g. macOS, this is not the default C compiler: gcc would do). Then, let's just type `make` from directory `bwtman`.


**Running**

Since this code is still a prototype, I created a shell script with hardwired input arguments, to make running it easier. The program uses file `HS22.fasta.indexed` included in the repository, which is a Burrows-Wheeler index that I pre-built on a human chromosome 22 sequence. Assuming the current directory is `bwtman`, it suffices to type:

```
./example-maws-filterByScore.sh
```

This single-threaded program traverses the BWT index, and prints to the output file `HS22.fasta.maws.filter` all minimal absent words (MAWs) that are expected to occur at least twice if the sequence were generated by a Markov model of large order (trained on the sequence itself).


**Example output**

The program prints to STDOUT a line with global statistics, followed by a histogram of lengths of all selected minimal absent words. The statistics are:
* length of the input sequence
* minimum length of a MAW (specified by the user)
* maximum length of a MAW (specified by the user)
* time to load the index (seconds)
* time to traverse the index and generate the output (seconds)
* peak memory usage (bytes)
* number of MAWs selected			
* minimum length of a selected MAW
* maximum length of an observed MAW
* fraction of maximal repeats that are the infix of a MAW

In the output file `HS22.fasta.maws.filter`, MAWs are represented in the following compact form: we print the maximal repeat *W* that is the infix of a MAW (or possibly of many MAWs) just once; then we print, on each line, the characters *a* and *b* such that *aWb* is a MAW, followed by several statistical scores on *aWb* (the fourth of which is the one we filtered by in the input). Example output:
